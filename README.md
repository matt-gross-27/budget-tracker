## Description
Budget tracker is a progressive web application for tracking your personal finances on the go. It has a simple, easy-to-use design and can be downloaded to your phone for a native app-like experience. 

If you travel a lot, then you know how frustrating bad network connection can be. Budget tracker allows you to have access to your ledger offline, and saves your line items to be uploaded to the cloud as soon as you get back to service.
